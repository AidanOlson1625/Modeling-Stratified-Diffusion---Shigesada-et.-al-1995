# Modeling-Stratified-Diffusion---Shigesada-et.-al-1995
A critical review of Shigesada et. al 1995, a paper in mathematical ecology.

Modeling Stratified Diffusion in Biological Invasions by Shigesada et al. [1995] proposes three Partial Differential Equation (PDE) systems that model range expansion of invasive species. These models address range expansion by a means of both neighborhood diffusion and long distance migration. The mathematical basis of these models come from the KPP Equation and McKendrick-Von Foerster Equation (MFE).

Consult "Final_Paper___Shigesada_et_al__1995.pdf" in the project files section for my full analysis and review of this paper. 

Files description:
- "Short Distance Dispersal.pptx" is the first presentation of content from Shigesada et al. focusing on their first model (strictly neighborhood diffusion). 
- "Aidan Olson - Traveling Waves and Stratified Diffusion.pptx" is the second presentation where I discuss the two models of stratified diffusion proposed by Shigesada and her team.
- "Shigesada et al. 1995.pdf" is the paper this project was based on.
