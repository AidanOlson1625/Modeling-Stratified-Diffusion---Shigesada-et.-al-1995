# Modeling-Stratified-Diffusion---Shigesada-et.-al-1995
A critical review of Shigesada et. al 1995, a paper in mathematical ecology.

Modeling Stratified Diffusion in Biological Invasions by Shigesada et al. [1995] proposes three Partial Differential Equation (PDE) systems that model range expansion of invasive species. These models address range expansion by a means of both neighborhood diffusion and long distance migration. The mathematical basis of these models come from the KPP Equation and McKendrick-Von Foerster Equation (MFE).
